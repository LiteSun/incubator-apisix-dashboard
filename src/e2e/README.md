### Local writing test cases

1. Installing dependencies and running local development environments

   ```Bash
   yarn install && yarn start
   ```

2. Add a new test case file to the `src/e2e` folder
3. Run test cases

   ```Bash
   yarn test
   ```

   If you want to run a particular test file separately, you can execute the following command

   ```Bash
   yarn test ${yourFileName}.e2e.js
   ```

   The test results will be displayed on the console.
